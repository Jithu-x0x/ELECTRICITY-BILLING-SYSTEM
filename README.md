# ELECTRICITY-BILLING-SYSTEM

The Java project on Electricity Bill Management System using Java Swing concepts creates a desktop application to manage electricity billing. It features a user-friendly interface for inputting customer details, recording meter readings, calculating bills, and generating printable statements.

There are two aspects of this application â€“ Admin and Customer.

The admin can create a new customer with new meter information assigned to the customer, view all customer details, and calculate the bills of all the customers.

The user can create his own account after the admin has created his meter information and once the account is created user can view his account information.

It lets User perform multiple operations like:-

1- User can Signup and create account to track all bill details.

2- User can Calculate and pay their Electricity Bill .

3- User can update their own personal details.

4- User can Generate Bill.

5- User can see their meter info and the payment status of the bill.
